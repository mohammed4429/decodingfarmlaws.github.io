<p>The Government by personate three recent bills for agricultural and marketing, contract farming and essential commodity has tried to cancelled the unhealthy and exploitative rules and procedures. The APMCs not only remain functional as a platform for marketing of agricultural produce but will be invigorate and become more transparent due to increased competition which is a precondition for a well-meaning market. The Government is perpetrate to make investments for the alternative system for marketing, better than the existing ones, as provided in the new Acts. These furnishing must be implemented with vigor and objectivity.</p>

<p>Indian Agriculture is characterized by millions of farmers cultivating more than 200 field, agricultural and plantation crops across the country in three distinct seasons of Kharif, Rabi and Zaid (summer) on over 141 million hectares of cultivated land. This generates more than 1000 million tones of farm produce taking together food grains, oilseeds, sugarcane, and fiber crops. Baring sugarcane, all other produce is marketed through the APMCs marketing system domestically with some omission like basmati rice, grapes and a small fraction of onion and flowers being exported. Over the period, the marketed surplus ratio (MSR) of all the assets has increased so much so that in crops like sunflower and safflower the marketed surplus ratio is 100 and cotton and jute close to 100 (GOI, 2019)'. In other crops also, the MSR has increased extensively during recent years. The other temperaments of the agricultural produce marketing in India is that these produces arrive in enormous bulk in the market in a very short span of time, many a time, beyond the penetration capacity of the domestic demand and the management capacity of the existing market infrastructure and the system. The price discovery in the markets of APMCs except for those which are under e-National Agriculture Market (eNAM) has been impenetrable and heavily monopolistic, in the hands of select aggregators and commission agents. The advances like contract farming for a pre-determined and mutually agreed price of a commodity experimented in the past on crops like tomato, potato, barley, etc in Punjab and Rajasthan and somewhere had mixed response and farmers at large had bookings in entering the contracts. The investment and active private participation have been terribly low due to frequent imposition of the essential commodity act (ECA) limiting the storage, often much lower than the existing inventory of the industrial organization or the warehouse capacity of the private traders. The ECA used to be enforce without thorough analysis. It cut on the larger private investment and proved excessive rather than facilitative.</p>
<p>Since 2000 onwards, multiple attempts were made to modernize the agricultural marketing system in India. In 2003, model APMC Act was developed and shared with the States, followed by a Committee of State Ministers, In-charge of Agriculture Marketing to Promote Reforms under the Chairmanship of Minister of Agriculture and marketing, Maharashtra submitted its report. As a follow up, the fruit and vegetables were brought out of APMC regulations and 20 States adapted to it. More concerted effort started after 2014.Consequently, Model Act on Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion Facilitation), 2017, Model Act on Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) 2018 were formulated and launched by the Government. It must be noted that these model acts were prepared after thorough deliberation and discussion with states, union territories, and experts and institutions. These Model acts were prepared to facilitate States to execute their own laws suitable to their local needs and conditions but received very lukewarm&nbsp;response.<br /><br />On June, 2020, the Government declared three ordinances on farmers produce trade and commerce, farmer agreement of price assurance and farm services; and essential commodity. Subsequently, the three Bill, i.e., The Farmers &lsquo;Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) negotiation of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and The Essential Commodity (Amendment) Bill, 2020 were passed by the Parliament on 20 September, 2020 to replace the ordinances. These Bill were treated by many as path-breaking and historic that would bring change in agriculture the way we had been doing and looking at it. However, a fraction of farmers, farmer bodies and expert started expressing the serious trepidation about these Bills. Bills. The so-called ill effect of these bills is being propagated amongst the farmers, largely, on imaginary grounds that these laws will lead to withdrawal of MSP, deprive the framers from their lands in favor of big private players and cause hoarding of essential cause hoarding of essential commodities. These trepidation, though imaginative, have somehow percolated deeply in a section of the farmers, the largest being those who have been the biggest beneficiaries of APMC dominated procurements and the price realization Another trepidation is about diluting the present-day agricultural marketing thereby affecting the benefits of millions of the farmers. While such ideological argument will continue, we must understand some basic facts that have necessitated such changes for the benefit of the farmers and those engage in agriculture.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Post 1991 liberalization, the gap in the income of the farmers and non-farm worker has been growing wider following that the benefits of the reforms in farm sector were too little and disintegrate and could not boost the income of the farmers. India is likely to produce huge surplus of agricultural commodities in next 10(NITI Aayog, 2018) much beyond the absorption capacity to the domestic market. The inadequacies of infrastructure and systems of marketing system present-day agricultural may not be able to handle this surplus. We need to become more competitive in terms of handling storage, quality standards for the global export targeted in developed and developing countries. Besides, for import substitution of edible oils, fruits and nuts and other agricultural terms, we require investment for post-harvest infrastructure, and logistics which has not been coming due to prohibitive regulations of the APMCs/ECA A market or aggregation centre close to production sites with some mechanism of price assurance can encourage the small and marginal farmers (SMF) to diversify towards high-value crops. Although, the consultation time from production cite to markets has reduced over time due to the road network development, the agriculture markets are too sparse and fragmented leading to glut and the price crash in some markets while shortage and high prices at major demand centers. Higher private investment could happen with reforms in agricultural market leading to price certainty and unabated flow of food items from centre of production to major centre of consumption. The reforms will lead to creation of different channels of marketing and more competition in the transaction leading to transparent price discovery and better price realization to the farmers.</p>
<p>The agriculture census 2015-16 has put quite 86 percent farmers under small and marginal category with average holdings of 0.38ha to about 68.5percent farm households. This means the likely surplus with them for offering to sale is low and far low to approach any APMC Mandi individually thanks to lack of economy of scale. It is outstanding, that there are about 2560 principal market yards and 4393 sub-yards in the country. On a mean one Mandi serve about 472 sq km against the norm of 1 market yard at about 80 sq km area. The kunjdas come to help the small growers but they use to offer much less price to producers. These are none but the legislators of commission agents for vegetables like Tomato, Potato, Brinjals, Green Peas and fruits like Mango, Guava, etc. The well settled village merchants in the rural markets have been the aggregators for staples since decades and the same system is operating even today except in some states where the public procurement has taken a deep dive to villages at least for rice and wheat. U.P., M.P. and Chhattisgarh are such States in the recent times. What is happening within the states/UTs like Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, North Eastern States and in Bihar is everyone's guess. We need more markets to facilitate to reduce the time to negotiate these destinations and active and direct sale by the farmers rather than going the route of commission agent as has been happening in the APMCs. What would be more important, is to establish a robust and accountable market intelligence system packed with technology and well-trained scientific manpower to minimize the chances of any manipulation in the prices of the produce. The FPTC Act provides for the freedom to sell and buy farm produce at any place in the country, promotes e-commerce and allows setting up of an electronic platform. It also offers the opportunity to the Government to negotiate to regulate the system, if the new system fails to work satisfactorily. The FPTC Act, 2020 legalizes all the transactions which were earlier put under the regulations and restriction by the APMCs. The direct purchase from the farmers at their farm as provided within the FPTC Act, 2020 are going to be empowering him to make a decision the worth of his produce. The State must reassure FPOs to become aggregators and in due course they will become active price negotiator rather than passive recipients of the price decided by commission agents in the APMC mandis.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The major apprehensions about the Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (APAFS) Bill 2020 is that corporate will deduct the lands of the farmers forcibly by manipulating the agreement. this is often highly imaginary and barren of any facts. it's noteworthy that the old contract farming act was adopted by the 20 States. The APAFS Bill 2020 is an enhancement over the old one. The APAFS Bill 2020 will facilitate an assured price to the farmers for his produce as mutually agreed between farmers and sponsor before the commencement of production operations, and therefore the technologies, services and inputs on mutually agreed terms and conditions for the assembly of desired quality produce. Further, the sponsor's role is restricted to buy for the produce at pre-decided price as agreed beforehand and supplying the quality inputs and services to farmers as per the contract. The sponsor neither approved to lease-in the land of the farmers, nor he/she can erect any assets permanent nature on farmers' land or modifying it or acquiring the ownership rights. The physical boundaries of the farmers land will remain unbroken so is his ownership rights. The farmers are going to be the only custodian of all production operations also. In fact, the APAFS is historic within the sense that farmers are empowered to not only negotiate for the worth of his produce before production except for the primary time within the history of Indian Agriculture, a farmer will dictate his terms for price settlement to a buyer. The contract farming with Nestle, for milk in Punjab's Moga district performing since 1961 could be an example to cite. Over one lakh farmers are combined with the contract. Nestle has been providing the technical guidance, feed, vaccines and veterinary services to take advantage of producers. A high order supply chain has been established supported a pre-announced weekly price supported the fat and solid content within the milk. The assets of the farmers haven't been taken by the MNC.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The ECA has been modified for agriculture and food stuff. The supply of commodities enlisted in ECA Such as cereals, edible oils and oils can only be regulated under extraordinary circumstances like war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamities. The transparent criterion has been laid down on imposing or regulating stock limits. This has inbuilt predictability in the Government's action price trigger rather than mere perception as used to happen in the past. The Government can intervene in the market for price control under the amended act as well. The recent action in imposing the stock limit on onions in October 2020 is the&nbsp;testimony of such provision. The criticism that a free hand has been given to stockiest and market manipulators is baseless. Further, the commodities like fertilizers and seeds, which are of much interest to farmers, have not been touched by the modifications. The modifications in ECA will encourage the big investment in creating much needed infrastructure like warehouses, cold storages, pack houses, and logistics. We must note that the gap between required and existing infrastructure is 70 percent in pack houses, 98 percent in reefer vehicles and 94 percent in ripening chambers (NCCD, 2015). By creating these infrastructures, much needed income to farmers will be augmented to a large extent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Farmer's Concern</strong></p>
<p>Last couple of months has been marked with the protest and agitation by the farmers in Haryana and Punjab and other states on the three bills passed by Parliament on 20 September 2020. These protests have settled two major consequences. First the Liberalization in the agriculture is not being allowed to be percolated well with farmers on the grounds devoid of the facts and imaginary. Two, the Government all institution Sneed the engage seriously in communicating with farmers for such a serious turn that has shaken the established system and traditionally deep-rooted relations between Adhatiyas-Commission agent and farmers. This relationship, over the years, worked beyond the price of produce and cemented as social safety and the Adhatiyas are being projected <a href="https://textfancy.com/text-faces/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">face savior</a> when farmers are in distress although, the farmers used to repay heavily for this so-called Charity by Adhatiyas. Another argument is the primary market yards and Sub yards under the APMCs have also been providing employment to millions of the landless and unemployed Semi skilled and unskilled laborers. There is need to educate the farmers that APMC lead Mandi system of Agriculture marketing, in India, has been opaque and monopolistic. The farmers were denied the access to participate in price Discovery and the direct transaction it was all in the clutches of the middleman and Commission agents. The government by enacting three bills for agricultural marketing, contract farming and essential commodity, has tried to eliminate the unhealthy and exploitative rules and procedures. The AMPCs not only remain functional as a platform for marketing of agricultural produce but will strengthen and become more transparent due to increased competition which is a pre-requisite for a well-meaning market. The Government is devoted to make investments for the different system for marketing, better than the existing ones, as provided in the new Acts. These provisions must be completed with vigor and objectivity.</p>

<p>The States have to take these productively and the Centre should provide matching grants, if needed for creating alternative mechanism. While the e-NAM and other initiatives will move on, most likely with the positive impact in long fun, the immediate action should be creating the awareness amongst farmers about the positives of the amendments with some live examples and records of advantages based on the real learning&rsquo;s of the farmers themselves rather than annualized or derived data of the surveys and reports for which there seems to be a trust deficit for the reasons unknown to many. The 721 KVKs, one in each district, under ICAR-SAUs governance may offer a great service in connecting the farmers through the ICT platforms and other communication means. We should plan and launch a campaign for awareness on recent market reforms&nbsp;through KVKs aptly funded by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and supported by the State Governments.</p>
